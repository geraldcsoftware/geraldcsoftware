## @geraldcsoftware, by Gerald Chifanzwa

My name is Gerald Chifanzwa. **@geraldcsoftware** and **@chifanzwasoftware** are my two tags for branding my code and personal apps.

I am a web developer, focusing mainly on front-end apps (mostly using Angular, but I'm also learning React), and web APIs using dotnet Core.

I am also quite good in docker, setting up and running containers. I am learning Kubernetes as well, and even though it has quite a lot of concepts to grasp, I'm getting there quite well.

Hopefully my content here will open up bigger opportunities for me.
